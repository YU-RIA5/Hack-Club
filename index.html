<h1> About Bunnies </h1>
<p> Bunnies are friendly like fluffy animals that love eating vegetables. (Not carrots especially!) I have a pet bunny at home myself and they are really friendly. Bunnies don't tend to bite or harm you if they trust you. Bunnies can eat most vegetables, and fruits. My bunny's faviorite food is the apple peel. (Layer of the outer shell of the apple.)</p>

<p>Bunnies drink up to 50ml-150ml based on their weight. If a bunny weighs 2kg, they could drink up to 300 ml of water a day! But how can you tell if your bunny is sick or injured? </p>
<h2>Sickness and Disease</h2>
<p>Bunnies will usually signal or hint to you that they are sick or injured. They might act unusually stiff or tired. They can also not eat to remind you that something is wrong. Take a look at this wikipedia page of bunnies!<p>

<p>Common conditions of pet rabbits include upper respiratory tract infections (snuffles), internal and external parasites, dental disease, gastrointestinal (GI) stasis, Encephalitozoon cuniculi, uterine problems (infections or cancer), and pododermatitis (foot sores or sore hocks).<p>
